# Mike Lang w/ IDE
_Simple programming language built on Java with Swing UI for the IDE_

## All programming and development by Michael Mathews 2025

# Project Purpose
To build a language without reference in order to glean insights, see what route I would take, and most importantly to pull my hair out (it has actually been fun).

### To run the project

1.) Download project files

2.) Run the main

3.) Enjoy. Will update as language grows. 

# SYNTAX
_Semi-colon based language (must end all statements with semi-colon)_

_Run button clears all lists/variables/outputs if nothing is typed on screen_

print - prints whatever is following it up until the next semi-colon(I.E. print Hello World;) Result is "Hello World".

int - stores whatever integer is following the equal sign, must end with semi-colon (I.E. int testVar = 10;) Result is 'testVar' stores the value of 10. 
If you use- print testVar; Result is 10.
